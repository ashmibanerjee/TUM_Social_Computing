    "# Exercise 3: Collaborative Filtering Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a simple collaborative filtering movie recommender in python. The input (attached to this exercise) is a subset of the MovieLens dataset (movielens.org), which contains 1862 movies, and 100K ratings. Find the dataset Piazza. The input is provided in two data files: u.item: is a listing of movies. Each row represents a movie with its attributes separated by ‘|’. We are only interested in the first two attributes which are the movie ID and the movie name. The second data file is u.data, which contains the movie ratings by users. A single row represents one user’s rating for one movie, and the attributes are (from left to right): user ID, movie ID, rating, and timestamp. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Exercise</b><br>\n",
    "The entry point to your recommendation engine should be a python method called “recommend” that takes a user ID, and paths to the two aforementioned data files. The method should return the top twenty recommended movies for that user <u><b>(The movies should not have been rated by that user before)</b></u>. The output should be a list of python tuples (sorted by recommended movies' expected ratings: highest first). Each tuple has the following two attributes: movie name, expected rating. You are free to design your recommendation engine the way you want but straightforward collborative filtering is highly recommended. Make sure that the code is clean, readable, and well documented. Test the code for user 15!\n",

    "### The Collaborative Filtering Recommender\n",
    "The idea of collaborative filtering is to find similar users to the target user. The items highly rated by those users are likely to be favorited by the target user. Therefore, the main problem is to find the list of users similar to the target user. There are several ways of measuring similarity. We could e.g. use cosine similarity but one of the simplest measures is Euclidean distance. Your program should calculate the absolute Euclidean distance between the target user and all other users in the dataset and calculate the expected rating for the target user for each movie in the dataset based on the forumla:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{ui} = \\frac{\\sum_{v \\in N_i(u)} w_{uv}r_{vi}}{\\sum_{v \\in N_i(u)} w_{uv}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $r_{ui}$ is the expected recommendation of item i for target user u. $N_i(u)$ is the set of similar users to target user u for the designated item i. $w_{uv}$ is the similarity score between users u and v (used as a weighting factor) for $r_{vi}$ which is the rating of user v for item i. \n",
