    "In social computing research, we need powerful tools to create, maniuplate, and display graphs. Luckily, there is a plethora of tools and libaries for that. For the next exercises, we are going to use igraph [http://igraph.org/] which also comes as a Python library [http://igraph.org/python/]. igraph provides rich graph data structures and many out-of-the-box functions to process graphs and calculate different metrics.\n",

    "Pick the library suitable for your Python version and your computer architecture. E.g.<br>\n",
    "python_igraph-0.7.1.post6-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl (this is for Python 2.7 (cp27), and amd 64 bit architecture)<br>\n",

    "A more detailled explanation of the installation can be found in the \"istallation guide iPython.pdf\" on Piazza.<br>\n",

    "<b>For Mac OS X</b>, the easiest way to install PyCairo is through homebrew [http://brew.sh/].<br>\n",

    "<b>Background information: Graph Visualization</b><br>\n",
    "Graph visualization is the research area in mathematics/computer science concerned with drawing graphs. It has applications in many fields, one of them is social computing. The quality of a graph visualization is measured based on certain criteria, for example: crossing minimization, and bend minimization. There are many graph drawing algorithms that vary in their quality according to the graph's application and size. One technique is drawing graphs by using physical analogies. The basic idea of this technique is to associate edges between graph nodes with physical forces acting upon the nodes and computing an energy minimum. By setting off the dynamics that is induced by the forces, the graph will finally settle into a natural optimal display. A famous algorithm that implements this technique is the Fruchtermann/Rheingold algorithm. Its basic idea is to replace the graph edges with mechanical springs, and let the springs move the system to a minimal energy state.<br>\n",

Now vary the parameters and run your code again. What do you notice? What happens when you increase the rewiring probability (e.g., to 0.25). <br> \n",
